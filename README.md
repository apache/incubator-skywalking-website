## How to add and manage markdown images in the site

You can put your markdown images in the path ``` /docs/.vuepress/public/static/ ``` and use the folder to separate the site parts. 

Such as adding a ```blog``` folder in ``` /docs/.vuepress/public/static/ ```,and then you can make a folder which names about your blog in it. Put the images in this named folder.

In markdown, you can use ```/docs/.vuepress/public/static/blog/{blogName}/{imageName} ``` path to add the image into markdown doc.
